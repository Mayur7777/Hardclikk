                <p class="text-black mt-4">
                    6.1 Unless otherwise agreed in writing, delivery of the Goods shall take place at the address
                    specified by the Buyer within the timescale specified by the Seller.
                    6.2 Standard delivery is conducted using a third-party courier, third party pallet carrier, or
                    Seller's own vehicle. Delivery times vary according to each mode of transportation as available by
                    3rd party couriers.

                    6.3 The delivery address specified by the Buyer must be safely accessible by truck between the hours
                    of 08.00 to 18.00 Monday to Friday and 08:00 to 10:00 on Saturdays.
                    6.4 The delivery service is completed by one person (the driver) up to the vehicle tailgate. It is
                    the responsibility of the buyer to ensure vehicle access including suitable parking and the handling
                    of the Goods beyond the vehicle tailgate.

                    NB. Should the Buyer require additional delivery services which are not covered by the standard
                    delivery terms such as date specific, on site product placement, product assembly and packaging
                    removal either or both of the following two options must be selected by the Buyer during order
                    review/checkout:

                    added to standard delivery charge.
                    6.5 The delivery period specified by the Seller is an estimate only and shall not be of the essence
                    of the contract. All deliveries conducted by the truck method will be booked in advance by telephone
                    and the Buyer shall make all arrangements necessary to take delivery of the Goods whenever they are
                    tendered for delivery
                    6.6 The Seller shall use its reasonable endeavours to meet any stated delivery period or booked
                    delivery date. In any event, time of delivery period or delivery booking shall not be of the essence

                    or any third party arising directly or indirectly out of any failure to meet any estimated delivery
                    period or date.
                    6.7 If the Seller is unable to commence delivery of the Goods for reasons beyond its control, then
                    the Seller shall be entitled to place the Goods in storage until such times as delivery may be
                    affected and the Buyer shall be liable for any expense associated with such storage.
                    6.8 If the Seller is unable to complete delivery whilst the Goods are in transit for reasons beyond
                    its control, then the Buyer shall be liable for any wasted delivery expenses incurred by the Seller.

                    signing any delivery receipt document. In the event of visible signs of transit damage, the Buyer
                    must clearly sign the goods received as ‘damaged' on the delivery receipt document before signing.
                    The Buyer shall then notify the Seller within 24 hours.
                    8.2 The Buyer shall inspect the Goods immediately upon receipt and shall notify the Seller within 1

                    clearly showing the order number obtained from the Seller and must be immediately available for
                    collection. The Seller will not accept any attempt to apply storage charges from the Buyer in this
                    period.
                    8.5 Where the claim of post-installation defect is made then it shall be the responsibility of the
                    Buyer to return the faulty Goods. The Buyer shall be entitled to replacement Goods or a full refund
                    including shipping costs provided a manufacturing fault can be established and not as a result of
                    misuse by the Buyer or a third-party user.
                    8.6 Goods to be returned must be delivered to the Seller between the hours of 08.00 to 17.30 Monday
                    to Friday at the Seller's premises within 14 days of reporting the fault.
                    8.7 Where returned Goods are found to be damaged but repairable due to the Buyer's or third party’s
                    misuse the Buyer will be liable for the cost of remedying such damage and all related shipping
                    costs.
